# Introduction 
A .NET 4.6.1 program that crudely simulates plankton in a pond. This was mainly developed as a way to help me understand WPF rendering. Physics are not intended to be realistic or accurate!

Ctrl+N randomises settings to create some unique combinations of physics and plankton settings.

# Notes
This is a fairly old project now, it was started in 2013 as a bit of fun and grew from there. It has received some quality of life updates but requires full separation of the model from the UI before it is progressed further.
